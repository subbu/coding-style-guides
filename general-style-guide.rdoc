= General Style Guide

=== Credits

_Mostly copied from http://github.com/chneukirchen/styleguide.git and altered for my personal taste_

== Formatting:

    * Use ASCII (or UTF-8, if you have to).
    * Use an empty line before the return value of a method (unless it
      only has one line), and an empty line between method definitions.
    * Don't leave unused code commented. Just delete it. GIT will remember that.
    * Use empty lines to break up a long method into logical paragraphs.
    * Keep lines fewer than 80 characters.
    * Avoid trailing whitespace.

== Spacing

    * Use 2 space indent. No tabs. (See #vim settings section)
    * Use spaces around operators (Arithmetic and Logical)
    * Use spaces after commas, colons and semicolons
    * Use spaces around { and before }
    * No spaces after (, [ and before ], ).
    * Don't use spaces for default values inside method definitions

== Comments:

    * Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation.
      Use two spaces after periods.
    * Avoid superfluous comments. Use meaningful method names to avoid comments.

== General

    * Avoid long methods.
    * Avoid long parameter lists.
    * Keep the code simple.
    * Don't overdesign.
    * Don't underdesign.
    * Don't code for future. Follow YAGNI.
    * Avoid bugs.
    * Be consistent.
    * Use common sense.
